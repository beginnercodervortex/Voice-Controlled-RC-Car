#  Voice-Controlled RC Car
This project demonstrates foundational skills in embedded systems, mobile-to-hardware communication, and rapid prototyping using low-cost components. It features a minimal, efficient hardware setup and simple code logic, making it ideal for scalable IoT applications or beginner robotics projects. It also demonstrates the seamless integration of IoT microcontrollers with mobile apps. Built using NodeMCU, motor driver, and MIT App Inventor shows how human-robot communication doesn't need to be complicated whatsoever.

##  Features

**Voice-Controlled Navigation:**
The car responds to voice commands such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop through a custom mobile app interface.

**Wireless Operation:**
Fully untethered — powered by a 7.4V battery with no USB or wired connection to a computer.

**Custom Mobile App (MIT App Inventor):**
App designed using drag-and-drop logic blocks for easy integration with the NodeMCU over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (depending on configuration).

**Dual DC Motor Control with L298N:**
Uses the L298N motor driver to control two DC motors independently, enabling precise directional movement.

**Simple & Expandable Codebase:**
Clean and minimal Arduino-style code (C++) that can be easily extended with additional features like sensors, LEDs, or obstacle avoidance.

**Compact Hardware Design:**
Neatly wired, beginner-friendly layout with basic electronics — ideal for those entering IoT or embedded systems.

**Modular & Upgradeable:**
Designed to support add-ons like buzzers, LEDs, obstacle sensors, or LiPo battery protection modules in future iterations.
